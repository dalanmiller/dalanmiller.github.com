# Installing pycurl

If you're like me and need to install pycurl and use some sort of self-compiled version of libcurl
because for whatever reason the system supplied one is from five years back you need to do this.

Install libcurl 

```
tar -xvzf libcurl* 
cd libcurl*
./configure --prefix=/path/to/custom/
make
make install
```

Install pycurl

This part always gets me since sometimes packages require custom arguments that are unique to that package. In this 
instance it's `--curl--config` which you can find by reading through pycurl's setup.py file. 

`pip install pycurl --install-option="--curl-config=/path/to/custom/bin/curl-config"`
