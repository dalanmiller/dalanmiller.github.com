		<h1>Quest for Interpolation</h1>
		<h5><time pubdate="pubdate">November 21, 2012</time> by <span class="author">Daniel Alan Miller</address></h5>

<p>Recently in some contract work I needed to find a function that fit a dataset that was given to me.
Programatically I needed this function in order to generate the right output for the UI I was creating.
Otherwise, I would be forced to arbitrarily map values to a result which is never ideal.</p>
<p>I found out that the thing I was looking for that I remembered doing all the time on my TI 83 - Silver Edition, is called interpolation and is a pretty intensely studied field.</p>
<p>I also found out how to accomplish this in Python and also generate the coeffiecients that are required to make a function. </p>
