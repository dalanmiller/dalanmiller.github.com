Recently in some contract work I needed to find a function that fit a dataset that was given to me.
Programatically I needed this function in order to generate the right output for the UI I was creating.
Otherwise, I would be forced to arbitrarily map values to a result which is never ideal.

I found out that the thing I was looking for that I remembered doing all the time on my TI 83 - Silver Edition, is called interpolation and is a pretty intensely studied field.

I also found out how to accomplish this in Python and also generate the coeffiecients that are required to make a function.
